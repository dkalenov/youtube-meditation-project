The customer will launch her YouTube channel on meditation and yoga classes aimed at a Russian-speaking audience. The goal is to collect data about competitors on YouTube and establish global trends in this area.

## Tasks:

1. Data Collection and Processing:
   - Collect data from YouTube, Google Trends, and Yandex Wordstat.
   - Process the collected data for further analysis.

2. Data Analysis:
   - Identify key competitors (views, likes, comments, average video length, date and time of publications, channel growth dynamics).
   - Determine the most popular tags used in competitor videos.
   - Analyze the most frequently used words, phrases, and expressions in the comments.
   - Identify related areas where similar content can be produced.

3. Visualization:
   - Create clear and informative visualizations to present the findings.
